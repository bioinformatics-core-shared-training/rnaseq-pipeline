# Making the most of mRNA sequencing experiments at CRUK-C.I.

## Description

High-throughput RNA-sequencing is now the standard technique for quantifying transcript abundance in a biological sample of interest. In this course we will describe the automated processes that take place once you submit library to the Genomics Core for RNA sequencing, and what data you should expect to receive from the Bioinformatics Core.

This will be the first in a series of courses aimed at explaining the computational pipelines available within the Bioinformatics Core. We will describe the steps involved to go from sequencing library to a list of genes that show statistically significant differences between your biological conditions of interest. Practical sessions will focus on the interpretation of the data you receive from the Bioinformatics Core, and **not** how the pipeline is executed.
